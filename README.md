# Password Audit Tool

A Python-based tool for auditing password strength, checking for breaches, generating secure passwords, and providing actionable recommendations. This tool leverages the [Have I Been Pwned](https://haveibeenpwned.com/API/v3#PwnedPasswords) API to check if passwords have been compromised in known data breaches.

## Features

- **Single Password Audit**: Analyze the strength and breach status of a single password.
- **Batch Password Audit**: Process a file containing multiple passwords and generate a detailed report.
- **Password Strength Analysis**: Evaluate passwords for length, character variety, and commonality.
- **Breach Checking**: Check if a password has been exposed in known breaches using the Pwned Passwords API.
- **Secure Password Generation**: Generate strong, random passwords.
- **Personalized Recommendations**: Get tips to improve password strength based on analysis.
- **Comprehensive Reporting**: Output results to the console and optionally to a report file.
